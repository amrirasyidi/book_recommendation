# [WIP]Book Recommendation Machine Learning Web App

## Author's Note
What I've learn from this project
1. VS code
1. Git
1. Collaborative filtering
    1. Making the content-user matrix
    1. Calculate similarity using cosine similarity
1. Create a "search engine" using TfidfVectorizer
---
## Goals
By the end of this project, we will create a web app with the following features:
1. Book search feature
1. "People also like" feature (collaborative filtering)
1. "Similar book" feature (clustering)
    1. Similarity by rating
    1. Similarity by content(?) (fiction with fiction etc)

## Steps
This project will go through
1. Preparing the GitHub repository
1. Data preparation
    1. Data Cleaning
    1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

    1. ~~Feature selection~~
1. Creating the model <-- ðŸ”¥ **Currently in this stage** ðŸ”¥
    1. Model training
    1. ~~Model assessment~~
    1. Model serialization (to make the model reusable in the web app)
1. Setting up the web app
    1. Flask
    1. Streamlit
    1. Running and testing the web app (postman)
1. Web app deployment
    1. Heroku
